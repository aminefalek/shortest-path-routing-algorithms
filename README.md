# shortest-path-routing-algorithms
Routing in Road Networks has been thoroughly studied since his grace Ser Edgard Dijkstra showed us the way (pun intended) with his elegant Algorithm. Since then, many algorithms leveraged the concepts brought by Dijkstra to efficiently compute a route in continental sized road networks in a mere microseconds.  I group here my own implementations of the main techniques used in the industry (Google Maps, Inrix, Bing ... etc) to compute your itineraries. All the presented algorithms are based on research papers for which I will provide a brief description along with the corresponding Java implementation.
